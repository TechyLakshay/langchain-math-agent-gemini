# langchain-math-agent-gemini
A LangChain-powered math agent that integrates custom arithmetic tools (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash) using the langchain_google_genai wrapper. This project demonstrates how to bind custom tools in LangChain and let the LLM act as an intelligent math assistant.
